# Relative flux trade-offs and optimization of metabolic network functionalities
## OS
* Code was tested on Fedora 31
## Dependencies
* Matlab -tested with 2019b
* COBRA toolbox 3.0
* GNU Linear Programming Kit(glpk) solver -tested with version 5.0
* Gurobi solver(tested with version 9.1.1)
## Setup
* Set up the COBRA toolbox following the installation instructions that can be found [here](https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/installation.html)
* Set up the glpk solver toolbox following the installation instruction that can be found [here](https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/75318-glpkmex-gnu-linear-programming-kit-glpk-mex-generator)
* Set up the Gurobi solver and connect it with the COBRA toolbox using install instructions that can be found [here](https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/installation.html#gurobi)
## Run FluTOr
To reproduce the results presented in the paper run the following scripts
* E. coli: Trade_offs_ecoliijo1366
* S. cerevisiae: Trade_offs_serevisiae
* A. thaliana: Trade_offs_athaliana
## How to apply FluTOr to another model
1. create a model which will be using to find tradeoffs. The output of the function must be a model named “model” and the name of the biomass reaction from the field “model.rxns”.
2. Give a name to the string variable “file_name” to the results you want to save it as 
3. flux accuracy must be defined as an integer variable names “rnd” (default value is 1e-5).
4. Then run the following codes respectively
   + model = FBA_FVA(model, rnd, biomass)
   + model = CPR(model, rnd,file_name); 
   + tradeoff_seaker(file_name, model, biomass);
